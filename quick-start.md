This is the fastest way to beginners to start using File Browser. Although, there are [other ways](../installation) to install it.

- [Download File Browser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/releases) and put it on your PATH.
- `cd` to the directory you want to browse in.
- Run `filemanager`.

Done! It will tell you the address in which File Browser is running. You only need to open it and use the following credentials (you should change them!):

- Username: ```admin```
- Password: ```admin```
